# Synthetic media fixtures

These files contain no third-party video, imagery, music or website code. They
were generated locally from FFmpeg's solid-color and sine-wave sources solely
for deterministic decoder/MSE tests. FFmpeg is a development-time generator;
its executable and libraries are not copied into Sylphra.

The complete-file fixture is a 64x64 solid blue H.264 Baseline video with a
440 Hz AAC audio track. The `mse` fixtures are a 64x64 solid green H.264
Baseline track and a 660 Hz AAC track split into initialization and media
segments.
